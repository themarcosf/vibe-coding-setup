## Web Design Rules and Framework

- Use semantic HTML5 elements for structure (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`).
- Apply CSS external classes for styling; avoid inline and internal styles.
- Use box-sizing: border-box for layout consistency.
- Use flexbox or CSS grid for layout. Do not use floats.

#### Web Design Ingredients

## Typography

- use only good and popular typefaces and play it safe.
- use only 1 or 2 typefaces per design.
- choose the right typeface according to the personality you want to convey.
- use web-safe fonts or Google Fonts.
- sans-serif: Inter, Open Sans, Roboto, Lato, Work Sans, Montserrat.
- serif: Merriweather, Aleo, Playfair Display, Cormorant, Cardo, Lora.
- do not justify text, use left-aligned text.
- do not center long text blocks. Small text blocks (e.g. in a hero section) can be centered.
- create a good reading experience by using less than 75 characters per line.
- text should usually not be completely black (#000000), but a dark grey (e.g. #222222 or #333333).
- for **any text**, never use a font weight under 400 (regular).
- for **body text**, use font sizes between 16px and 32px and a line height between 1.5 and 2.0.
- for **long texts** (like a blog post), use a size of 20px or even bigger.
- for **headings**:
  - go really big (50px+) and bold (600+), **depending on personality**
  - use a line height below 1.5
  - decrease letter spacing slightly (e.g. -0.5px)
  - for short headings, experiment with all-caps and increased letter spacing (e.g. 1px)
- spacing system (px): 2 / 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 24 / 32 / 48 / 64 / 80 / 96 / 128
- font size system (px): 10 / 12 / 14 / 16 / 18 / 20 / 24 / 30 / 36 / 44 / 52 / 62 / 74 / 86 / 98

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

## Colors

- make the main color match the website personality according to color theory and psychology.
  - **red** draws a lot of attention, and symbolizes power, passion, and excitement.
  - **orange** is less aggressive, and conveys happiness, cheerfulness, and creativity.
  - **yellow** means joy, brightness, and intelligence.
  - **green** represents harmony, nature, growth, and health.
  - **blue** is associated with peace, trustworthiness, and professionalism.
  - **purple** conveys wealth, wisdom, and magic.
  - **pink** represents romance, care, and affection.
  - **brown** is associated with nature, durability and comfort.
  - **black** symbolizes power, elegance and minimalism, but also grief and sorrow.
- use good color tones (not too bright, not too dark).
- use a color palette with 3-5 colors (main color, secondary color, neutral colors).
- for diversity, use lighter and darker versions of the colors (tints and shades).
- use the main color to draw attention to important elements (e.g. call-to-action buttons).
- use colors to add **interesting accents** or make **entire components or sections** stand out.
- on dark colored backgrounds, use a tint of the main color for text (e.g. light blue on dark blue).

## Images and illustrations

- different types of images: product photos, storytelling photos, illustrations, patterns
- use images to support the message and story of the website.
- prefer original images or original-looking stock images.
- show real people to trigger user's emotions.
- cropping goes a long way to create a good composition.
- to account for high-res screens, use images with at least 2x the size they will be displayed at.
- compress images to reduce file size (e.g. using [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/)).
- when using multiple images side-by-side, make sure they have the exact same dimensions.
- methods of handling text on images:
  - darken or brighten the image (completely or partially, using gradients)
  - position text into neutral areas of the image
  - put text in a box

## Icons

- use only one icon pack for consistency.
- use only SVG icons or icon fonts. Do not use bitmap image formats (.jpg and .png).
- use icons to provide visual assistance to text content.
- use icons for product feature blocks.
- use icons associated with actions and label them.
- use icons as bullet points
- to keep icons neutral, use same color as text. To draw more attention, use different color.
- do not make icons larger than what they were designed for. If needed, enclose them in a shape.

- [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) - free, MIT-licensed icons
- [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/) - flexible icon family
- [Ionicons](https://ionicons.com/) - premium icons
- [Icons8](https://icons8.com/icons) - free and premium icons

## Shadows

- only use shadows if it makes sense for the design personality.
- use shadows in small doses to add depth and separation.
- do not make shadows too dark or too large.
- use small shadows for smaller elements that should stand out (to draw attention).
- use medium-sized shadows for larger areas that should stand out a bit more.
- use large shadows only for elements that should really float above the interface.
- use changing shadows on hover to indicate interactivity.
  - on hover: medium-sized shadow **pulls** button closer to the user
  - on click: smaller shadow **pushes** button back into the interface
- experiment with colored shadows (using a tint of the main color).

## Border radius

- use border radius to increase the playfulness and fund of the design, to make it less serious.
- typefaces have a certain roundness: make sure that border-radius matches the roundness of the typeface.
- use border radius on buttons, images, around icons, standout sections, and other elements that should be less serious.

## Whitespace

- the right amount of whitespace makes a design look clean and organized.
- use whitespace between sections, around text blocks, and between elements in a component.
- inside groups of elements, use whitespace instead of borders or lines to separate elements.
- the more some elements or groups of elements belong together, the less whitespace you should use between them (law of proximity).
- match other design choices. Big text or big icons require more whitespace.
- whitespace system (px): 2 / 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 24 / 32 / 48 / 64 / 80 / 96 / 128

## Visual hierarchy

- create a clear visual hierarchy to draw attention to the most important elements first.
- combine position size, colors, spacing, borders and shadows to establish a meaningful visual hierarchy.
- position important elements closer to the top of the page.
- use images mindfully, as they draw a lot of attention. Larger images get more attention.
- whitespace creates separation, so use whitespace strategically to highlight important elements.

## User experience

#### Rules for usability

- do not design complicated layouts. Do not reinvent the wheel. Use patterns that users know.
- make call-to-action buttons the most prominent element, and make the text descriptive.
- use blue text and underlined text only for links.
- animations should have a clear purpose and be fast: between 200ms and 500ms
- in forms, align labels and fields in a single vertical line, to make the form easier to scan.
- offer users good feedback for all actions: form errors, form success, etc.

#### Rules for content

- use a descriptive, keyword-focused headline on the main page. Do not be vague or fancy!
- only include relevant information, efficiently! Cut out fluff and make the content 100% clear.
- break up long text with sub-headings, images, block quotes, bullet points, etc.

## Components and layout

- use common elements and components to convey the information
- combine components into layouts using common layout patterns
- assemble different layout areas into a complete final page

## Responsive design

- fluid layouts
    - add <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> in the head
    - to allow webpage to adapt to the current viewport width (or height)
    - use relative units (%, em, rem, vw, vh) instead of absolute units (px)
    - use `max-width` instead of width for containers
- responsive units
    - use `rem` unit instead of `px` for most lengths
    - set html root font size to 62.5% (1rem = 10px) for easier calculations
- flexible images
    - use % for image dimensions, together with the `max-width` property
- media queries
    - use media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes
    - common breakpoints (em): 37.5 (600px), 56.25 (900px), 75 (1200px), 112.5 (1800px)
